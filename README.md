# MastersThesis
The code written for my Master's thesis. There are code dependencies (e.g. shimming codes) not contained here as they may contain proprietary information belonging to Siemens.

## Folders:
### cnnKtShim:
  Contains the code for the k_T-shimming by CNN.
### redoRFshim:
  Contains the code for the RF-shimming by MLP Networks.
### univKtPulse
  Contains partially the code for the kT-UP-generation.
### volunteerDiscernment
  Contains the code for the volunteer discernment method.
  
## Extra Note:
The code added here is not runable without the required dependencies, mainly consisting of the shimming codes (e.g. dcshim.m, acshim.m, ktshim.m) and the 3DREAM- and DREAM data from the 17 volunteer scans.
